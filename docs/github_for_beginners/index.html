            <h2 id="before-we-start-let-s-focus-on-why">Before we start.. Let's focus on why?</h2><p>I also got to know about <strong>GitHub </strong>and the many uses it offers after I entered university, and it wasn't until I started my Internship, that I actually looked up on how to use and get familiar with <strong>GitHub</strong>. Today, I understand that <strong>GitHub </strong>is a very power tool with a wide variety of uses and applications, and is being used all over the world, and is the most widely used <strong><em>Git </em></strong>based repository hosting service. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2020/08/image--2-.png" class="kg-image"></figure><h3 id="why-should-you-learn-about-github">Why should you learn about GitHub?</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2020/08/Untitled.png" class="kg-image"></figure><ul><li>Ease of providing Public Access - It makes it easy to contribute to your open source projects.

(This might be the case for many of you as well 😉) All the other Engineers at the company were using <strong>Bitbucket </strong>platform for code development, sharing, &amp; code reviews. I was able to manage to grasp this tool at a "beginner" level with understanding of a few basic commands, and now let me share that knowledge with all of you.</p><h3 id="the-trusty-git-cheat-sheet-">The trusty git-cheat-sheet.. 😃</h3><p>This is the official <strong>GitHub <em>git</em>-<em>cheat-sheet</em></strong> which features the most important and commonly used <em><strong>Git</strong></em> commands for easy reference.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf&embedded=true" height="800" width="100%"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>It is a great place to start and grasp the "beginner" level basics of this tool.</p><h2 id="we-start-with-github-account-creation">We start with GitHub account creation </h2><p>Use your credentials to create a <strong>GitHub </strong>account at <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a> and Sign Up.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2020/08/image-7.png" class="kg-image"></figure><p>You can always Sign in to <strong>GitHub</strong> using the credentials you used and stay signed in.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2020/08/image-8.png" class="kg-image"></figure><p>After you sign in, you can go to your profile settings and add a few personalized touch ups here and there.

Nerdy! GitHub also allows you to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/14/what-exactly-is-github-anyway/" rel="noopener nofollow">store and view every draft of a code file</a> you have made, ever, easily allowing for you to not only view progress, but <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert" rel="noopener nofollow">revert</a> to a file’s earlier versions if (when) mistakes occur. Additionally, while one can manually add, remove, and alter files directly from GitHub.com, one can also adapt the more tech-savvy version: dealing with GitHub entirely from the command line.</p><p>Let's begin by discussing the basics of git every "beginner" can survive with.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf&embedded=true" height="800" width="100%"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="clone">Clone</h3><p>The first step in editing &amp; sharing code in GitHub is to create a <strong><strong>repository</strong></strong>. Think of a repository as a simple file, which will later contain all of your code files &amp; history for a particular coding project. You can manually create a repository (or as the kids call it, a ‘repo’) by navigating to your GitHub home page and smashing that green ‘NEW’ button. Name your repo something simple, like <strong><strong>MyProject.</strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong><strong>Clone</strong></strong> is a way for you to take that folder from GitHub.com and duplicate it into your computer’s file directory. This will allow you to edit and run your code files from a text editor instead of directly from GitHub, and is how any of your collaborators will be able to access code as well. <strong><strong>Cloning</strong></strong> means there exist two copies of your project: the one online on GitHub.com to share with the world, and the one on your local computer for solely you to edit and view before choosing to publish.</p><p>Similar to how we only post the best photos of ourselves to Instagram, we only push the best versions of our code to GitHub.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git</code></pre><p>After running the above <strong><strong>git clone</strong></strong> command from your terminal, you will see a new folder entitled <strong><strong>MyProject</strong></strong> in your local files.</p><h3 id="commit">Commit </h3><p></p><h3></h3><h3 id="push-function push() { [native code] }1">Push</h3><p>Say I’ve created an index.html file in my text editor and I want to share it on the <strong><strong>MyProject</strong></strong> repository, so that all my coworkers can see how awesome I am at coding in HTML.</p><p>Using the command line, the <strong><strong>git status</strong></strong> command will notify you of any changes your GitHub repo recognizes in your local folder, that do not yet exist online. Typing <strong><strong>git status</strong></strong> will display your <strong><strong>index.html</strong></strong> in red, indicating it has not yet been <strong><strong>pushed </strong></strong>to your GitHub repo.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">git add index.html
git commit -m "added index.html file"
git push</code></pre><p>Pushing is a three step process. First, <strong><strong>git add index.html</strong></strong> to signify that you’d like to add your index.html file to your GitHup repo. Second, <strong><strong>git commit -m “message”</strong></strong>, replacing the placeholder message with the <em><em>meaning</em></em> of your adding this file. It is best to keep commit messages specific, so that when you share your code, coworkers (&amp; your followers) can understand your code creating process exactly. Lastly, <strong><strong>git push</strong></strong> to send your added files &amp; commit message off to your GitHub repo.</p><h3 id="pull">Pull</h3><p>As mentioned, your project code is simultaneously existing both locally and virtually. What if a colleague updates a file &amp; pushes it to the <strong><strong>MyProject</strong></strong> repo — how do you ensure you can access this file &amp; work on it, when it does not exist on your local computer?</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">git pull</code></pre><p>The answer is simple: <strong><strong>git pull</strong></strong>. Pulling from your GitHub repo and into your local computer makes sure that your local folder contains the most recent versions of the files in your repository. If you <strong><strong>pull</strong></strong> prior to editing any code, you’ll ensure that you’re not making any updates which already exist in your repo.</p><p></p><p>References</p><ol><li><a href="https://medium.com/@yoyomade/github-for-dummies-96f753f96a59">https://medium.com/@yoyomade/github-for-dummies-96f753f96a59</a></li><li><a href="https://apiumhub.com/tech-blog-barcelona/using-github/">https://apiumhub.com/tech-blog-barcelona/using-github/</a></li></ol>
