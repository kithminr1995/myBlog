        <div class="content">
            <h2 id="how-things-got-to-where-they-are-now-"><strong>How things got to where they are now...</strong></h2><p>I have been interested in creating a personal blog since I was in my second year at University, back in 2017. I gave it a try by making it on <a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress </a>once, but it didn't feel personal enough. I realized that I didn't just want to have my own blog, I wanted to create it myself personally, like I engineered it with a bit of my lazy computer programming skills. So until then, I collected all the documents and images of my projects and endeavors and waited for the opportunity to do this.</p><p>I was able to get the exact opportunity to re-attempt this in 2020 when I saw the <a href="https://blog.ramith.fyi/static/">blog</a> of a young undergraduate from the 17 batch; Ramith Hettiarachchi, who also happens to be from the SEF ScholarX Class of 2019. </p><p>Ramith had a very attractive blog, which looked very personal and well developed. I would like to extend my personal thanks to Ramith for his advice and support (and especially on how he got me out of the Netlify trouble which could have ended up in this particular article being entirely different to what it is now), in helping me write about my experience on "HOW I MADE MY ¬†SELF-HOSTED PERSONAL BLOG USING GHOST AND GITHUB PAGES".</p><blockquote>PLEASE NOTE: I did everything on my Laptop which was running Windows 10. I didn't dual boot my laptop to get Linux thanks to the amazing work they have done with Windows Subsystem for Linux ¬†(WSL). Also, I did everything for FREE, which is how I like to work on projects. &gt;Great results for Low Budget! üòâ </blockquote><hr><h2 id="what-i-wanted-to-make-here">What I wanted to make here?</h2><p>I was very excited about the year 2020, even though (so far) it was one of the most terrible years in Human History. This was solely due to the fact that 2020 opened up new avenues for me (and Netflix said a Narnia remake is coming soon üòç), in various fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Blogging and Product Development Research to name a few. I wanted to pick up some new skills I could use in my future career as well.</p><p>Ramith had used this API called <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, which was a powerful and unique tool for publishing online content. Together with Gatsby, I believed that it gave the complete FRONT-END framework I required for my custom blog.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2020/05/11-1.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>How Ghost integrates with Gatsby.</figcaption></figure><p>The entire blog had to be hosted on github, and then I could build and deploy my new project with Netlify, and it will be hosted on the internet like any other Blog.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2020/05/12-1.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>How Ghost+Gatsby can be used to host on Netlify</figcaption></figure><blockquote>NOTE: This was how I envisioned everything to be developed at first. However the Netlify integration did not work out the way it was supposed to, and me and Ramith spent some time looking for other alternative methods. So this post is actually taking one such alternative approach and avoiding a whole lot of mess and time-waste. You're welcome üòÑ</blockquote><p>Anyways, when I started to create this new blog, I found out that these websites here are very influential for my work.
