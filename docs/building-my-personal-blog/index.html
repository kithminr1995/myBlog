            <h2 id="how-things-got-to-where-they-are-now-"><strong>How things got to where they are now...</strong></h2><p>I have been interested in creating a personal blog since I was in my second year at University, back in 2017. I gave a try at making it on <a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress </a>once, but it didn't feel personal enough. I realized that I didn't just want to have my own blog, I wanted to create it personally, like i engineered it with a little lazy computer programming skills. So I collected all the documents and images and waited for the opportunity to do this.</p><p>I was able to get a great opportunity to re-attempt this in 2020 when I saw the <a href="https://blog.ramith.fyi/static/">blog</a> of a young  undergraduate from the 17 batch; Ramith Hettiarachchi, who also happens to be a SEF ScholarX member of 2019. </p><p>Ramith had a very attractive blog, which looked very personal and well developed. I would like to extend my personal thanks to Ramith for his advice and support, in helping me write about this experience on "HOW I MADE MY PERSONAL SELF-HOSTED BLOG USING GHOST AND GATSBY".</p><blockquote>PLEASE NOTE: I did everything on my Laptop which was running Windows 10. I didn't dual boot and get linux thanks to the amazing done Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL).

I wanted to pick up some new skills I could use in my future career as well.</p><p>Ramith had used this API called <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, which was powerful and unique for publishing online.
