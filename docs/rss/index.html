I gave a try at making it on <a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress </a>once, but it didn't feel personal enough. I realized that I didn't just want to have my own blog, I wanted to create it personally, like i engineered it with a little lazy computer programming skills. So I collected all the documents and images and waited for the opportunity to do this.</p><p>I was able to get a great opportunity to re-attempt this in 2020 when I saw the <a href="https://blog.ramith.fyi/static/">blog</a> of a young  undergraduate from the 17 batch; Ramith Hettiarachchi, who also happens to be a SEF ScholarX member of 2019. </p><p>Ramith had a very attractive blog, which looked very personal and well developed. I would like to extend my personal thanks to Ramith for his advice and support, in helping me write about this experience on "HOW I MADE MY PERSONAL SELF-HOSTED BLOG USING GHOST AND GATSBY".</p><blockquote>PLEASE NOTE: I did everything on my Laptop which was running Windows 10. I didn't dual boot and get linux thanks to the amazing done Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL). Also, I did everything for FREE!</blockquote><hr><h2 id="what-i-wanted-to-make-here">What I wanted to make here?</h2><p>I was very excited about the year 2020, even though (so far) it was one of the most terrible years in Human History. This was solely due to 2020 opening new avenues for me, in various fields such as AI, Blogging and Product Development Research to name a few. I wanted to pick up some new skills I could use in my future career as well.</p><p>Ramith had used this API called <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, which was powerful and unique for publishing online. Together with gatsby, it gave the complete FRONT-END framework I required for my custom blog.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/11-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Building my personal blog ✍️"><figcaption>How ghost intergrates with gatsby.</figcaption></figure><p>The entire blog had to be hosted on Github, and then I could build and deploy my new project with Netlify, and it will be hosted on the internet like any other Blog.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/12-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Building my personal blog ✍️"><figcaption>How Ghost+Gatsby can be used to host on Netlify.</figcaption></figure><p>Basically, When I started to create this new blog, I found out that these websites here very influential for my work.</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.conordewey.com/blog/building-my-blog-with-gatsby-and-ghost/">https://www.conordewey.com/blog/building-my-blog-with-gatsby-and-ghost/</a></li><li><a href="https://josebrowne.com/tutorial-static-blog-using-headless-ghost-2-0-gatsby-netlify/">https://josebrowne.com/tutorial-static-blog-using-headless-ghost-2-0-gatsby-netlify/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.devopscycle.com/ghost-gatsby-netlify-jamstack/">https://www.devopscycle.com/ghost-gatsby-netlify-jamstack/</a></li></ol><blockquote>PLEASE NOTE: They used to do this kind of blog creation using a package called buster, but it is outdated and not available for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
