I gave it a try by making it on <a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress </a>once, but it didn't feel personal enough. I realized that I didn't just want to have my own blog, I wanted to create it myself personally, like I engineered it with a bit of my lazy computer programming skills. So until then, I collected all the documents and images of my projects and endeavors and waited for the opportunity to do this.</p><p>I was able to get the exact opportunity to re-attempt this in 2020 when I saw the <a href="https://blog.ramith.fyi/static/">blog</a> of a young undergraduate from the 17 batch; Ramith Hettiarachchi, who also happens to be from the SEF ScholarX Class of 2019. </p><p>Ramith had a very attractive blog, which looked very personal and well developed. I would like to extend my personal thanks to Ramith for his advice and support (and especially on how he got me out of the Netlify trouble which could have ended up in this particular article being entirely different to what it is now), in helping me write about my experience on "HOW I MADE MY ¬†SELF-HOSTED PERSONAL BLOG USING GHOST AND GITHUB PAGES".</p><blockquote>PLEASE NOTE: I did everything on my Laptop which was running Windows 10. I didn't dual boot my laptop to get Linux thanks to the amazing work they have done with Windows Subsystem for Linux ¬†(WSL). Also, I did everything for FREE, which is how I like to work on projects. &gt;Great results for Low Budget! üòâ </blockquote><h2 id="what-i-wanted-to-build">What I wanted to build?</h2><p>I was very excited about the year 2020, even though (so far) it was one of the most terrible years in Human History. This was solely due to the fact that 2020 opened up new avenues for me (and Netflix said a Narnia remake is coming soon üòç), in various fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Blogging and Product Development Research to name a few. I wanted to pick up some new skills I could use in my future career as well.</p><p>Ramith had used this API called <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, which was a powerful and unique tool for publishing online content. Together with Gatsby, I believed that it gave the complete FRONT-END framework I required for my custom blog.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/11-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Building my personal blog ‚úçÔ∏è"><figcaption>How Ghost integrates with Gatsby.</figcaption></figure><p>The entire blog had to be hosted on GitHub, and then I could build and deploy my new project with Netlify, and it will be hosted on the internet like any other Blog.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/12-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Building my personal blog ‚úçÔ∏è"><figcaption>How Ghost+Gatsby can be used to host on Netlify</figcaption></figure><blockquote>NOTE: This was how I envisioned everything to be developed at first. However the Netlify integration did not work out the way it was supposed to, and me and Ramith spent some time looking for other alternative methods. So this post is actually taking one such alternative approach and avoiding a whole lot of mess and time-waste. You're welcome üòÑ</blockquote><p>Anyways, when I started to create this new blog, I found out that these websites here are very influential for my work.

I believe that they are doing a really wonderful endeavor by helping the local students in our country get connected with internationally acclaimed industrial and academic personnel. There efforts are truly helping to convert the long existing Brain Drain of Sri Lanka into a Brain Gain, of which I am very supportive to be a part of and will continue to help towards this endeavor.</p><p>To begin the first chapter of my ScholarX journey, I contacted my mentor Ruwandi Kariyawasam, Ph.D. Candidate at University of Toronto for the first time on April 27<sup>th</sup>. Before sending her my first email, I went on the internet to search about her research profile like a responsible freshly selected mentee.</p><p>These were the main articles I found and referred about my mentor, who was a researcher in the field of tropical infectious diseases with a background in evolutionary genetics.</p><ul><li><a href="https://ims.utoronto.ca/ruwandi-kariyawasam/">https://ims.utoronto.ca/ruwandi-kariyawasam/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruwandikariyawasam/?originalSubdomain=ca">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruwandikariyawasam/?originalSubdomain=ca</a></li><li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ruwandi_Kariyawasam">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ruwandi_Kariyawasam</a></li></ul><p>I found this to be really fascinating and given that the world was also facing the Covid-19 pandemic during this period. This was an opportunity for me to tell about my interest in artificial intelligence and share this article I recently read <a href="https://diginomica.com/how-canadian-ai-start-bluedot-spotted-coronavirus-anyone-else-had-clue">https://diginomica.com/how-canadian-ai-start-bluedot-spotted-coronavirus-anyone-else-had-clue</a> about how AI is being used together with infectious diseases.</p><p>We had our first google meets meeting for Scholar X Class of 2020 on May 1<sup>st</sup> , where we got to meet and get advice from Akshika, Saumiyaa and Minuri, the main organizers behind the ScholarX 2020 program. Minuri gave us this <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html">neat tool</a>, to schedule our meetings with our mentors affectively, regardless of the time zone differences. </p><p>So I reached out to Ruwandi by email by introducing myself and a bit about my background from the last 4 years. After we exchanged introductions and the mandatory ScholarX 2020 guidelines via email, I was wondering if I should send her my CV. Since at our first ScholarX meeting, Saumiyaa had mentioned that our mentors were not provided with our CVs, ¬†I thought it would be good to send her my CV. In reply to the email I sent with my CV, Ruwandi replied with a suggestion to arrange our first meeting on the 14<sup>th</sup> of May. I was at home during the Lockdown, and I was very enthusiastic to meet her, and agreed for the meeting. She suggested that we meet around 8.30 am in SL time, and I thought I would go ahead and use that tool Minuri gave us. This is what the meeting looked like. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/06/31-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="My First Chapter of ScholarX '20"><figcaption>It was 11.00 pm for Ruwandi in Toronto!</figcaption></figure><p>So, I prepared my questions and waited till the date of our first meeting. Even though I was not used to waking up very early the past few weeks, I made sure to wake up at 7.45 am on Thursday, 14<sup>th</sup> of May. I got up and freshened up and logged on to Skype and tried to find her Skype ID. It was around 8.30 am now, and I found her on skype and sent her message saying that I was online. However, she did not respond for a while, and I received a message from another person saying ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm sorry late for being late‚Äù and it happened to be Ruwandi on a different account. From the first moment we got to know each other, she was really nice and helpful in person as she was on email. I felt like I was very happy to have chosen her as my mentor and mostly to have a mentor who was a Canadian.</p><p>Our meeting went on for around 45 minutes meeting, which was around 11.45 pm from her time. I was very grateful that she would set aside so much time for me, that late at night. She was also kind enough to send me some really useful links for the things we discussed during the meeting as well. Some of the things we discussed during that meeting are listed below.</p><ul><li>How is Canada a potential higher studies venue for me and details about Graduate Studies in Canada - <a href="https://www.educanada.ca/programs-programmes/graduate-studies-etudes-superieures.aspx?lang=eng">https://www.educanada.ca/programs-programmes/graduate-studies-etudes-superieures.aspx?lang=eng</a></li><li>How to go through the research funding and awards opportunities for doing higher studies in Canada - <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/science/researchfunding.html">https://www.canada.ca/en/services/science/researchfunding.html</a></li><li>Also discussed about researching the start-ups in Toronto related to Biomedical Sector - MaRS Discovery District (BlueDot is actually located here): <a href="https://www.marsdd.com/">https://www.marsdd.com/</a></li><li>Go through opportunities in UBC Toronto McMasters for Engineering PhDs <a href="https://www.bme.ubc.ca/">https://www.bme.ubc.ca/</a>													<a href="https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/">https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/</a></li><li>About writing my first blog post about the ScholarX program and what we learned and shared, as well as making my website.</li></ul><p>She mentioned that my CV was really good, and that I would have a good chance of getting into a nice program and mentioned some things I could improve on. I noted down her suggestions for everything and also decided that I would convert my CV into an academic CV for future use as well.</p><p>We decided to have another meeting on May 28<sup>th</sup>, after I researched all of the information I found on the above matters. However, she had informed me later that week that we will have to reschedule our next meeting, since she will be defending her Ph.D. thesis in the middle of June. I wished her all the very best with her defense and told her that I will be well prepared for the next meeting with her, once her thesis defense was concluded. So, I have been spending my time doing some research on these topics that past few weeks and well as going to be spending the upcoming weeks on this matter as well.</p><p>I found some articles informative articles and content which I used for this, which I have listed below</p><ul><li>How Uthmani Ambawattage, a Graduate in Statistics got selected to a Canadian University - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-got-selected-graduate-school-ranked-8th-canada-ambawattage/">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-got-selected-graduate-school-ranked-8th-canada-ambawattage/</a></li><li>AcadeMix project by SEF - <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XhIM3iQTuHkHp7htM2dZlUCY_3yg-ulFy6bd6ZluR4g/edit#gid=795641311">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XhIM3iQTuHkHp7htM2dZlUCY_3yg-ulFy6bd6ZluR4g/edit#gid=795641311</a></li></ul><p>I also decided to get some advice from Eran Withana from his Webinar - The Journey After the College Degree: Getting into Grad School and Beyond - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sustainableeducationfoundation/videos/598750607475382/"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sustainableeducationfoundation/videos/613380142679095/">https://www.facebook.com/sustainableeducationfoundation/videos/598750607475382/</a></a>. You can find those details available in another post I have published.</p><p>I am hoping to write about the questions I came up with, how I drafted my academic CV and my SOP, and how I researched into the types of fields I should go in for my higher studies; all of which were the things I wanted to present at my next meeting.
