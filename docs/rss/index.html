Nerdy! GitHub also allows you to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/14/what-exactly-is-github-anyway/" rel="noopener nofollow">store and view every draft of a code file</a> you have made, ever, easily allowing for you to not only view progress, but <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert" rel="noopener nofollow">revert</a> to a file‚Äôs earlier versions if (when) mistakes occur. Additionally, while one can manually add, remove, and alter files directly from GitHub.com, one can also adapt the more tech-savvy version: dealing with GitHub entirely from the command line.</p><p>Let's begin by discussing the basics of git every "beginner" can survive with.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf&embedded=true" height="800" width="100%"></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id="clone">Clone</h3><p>The first step in editing &amp; sharing code in GitHub is to create a <strong><strong>repository</strong></strong>. Think of a repository as a simple file, which will later contain all of your code files &amp; history for a particular coding project. You can manually create a repository (or as the kids call it, a ‚Äòrepository‚Äô) by navigating to your GitHub home page and smashing that green ‚ÄòNEW‚Äô button. Name your repository something simple, like <strong><strong>MyProject.</strong></strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/08/image-22.png" class="kg-image" alt="GitHub for Everyone: A discussion with IQ Labs on how versatile and efficient this tool is..."></figure><p><strong><strong>Clone</strong></strong> is a way for you to take that folder from GitHub.com and duplicate it into your computer‚Äôs file directory. This will allow you to edit and run your code files from a text editor instead of directly from GitHub, and is how any of your collaborators will be able to access code as well. <strong><strong>Cloning</strong></strong> means there exist two copies of your project: the one online on GitHub.com to share with the world, and the one on your local computer for solely you to edit and view before choosing to publish.</p><p>Similar to how we only post the best photos of ourselves to Instagram, we only push the best versions of our code to GitHub.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepoName.git</code></pre><p>After running the above <strong><strong>git clone</strong></strong> command from your terminal, you will see a new folder entitled <strong><strong>MyProject</strong></strong> in your local files.</p><h3 id="commit">Commit </h3><p>A Git <strong>commit</strong> is a snapshot of the hierarchy (Git tree) and the contents of the files (Git blob) in a Git repository. These endpoints allow you to read and write <strong>commit</strong> objects to your Git database on <strong>GitHub</strong>.</p><p>Similar to saving a file that's been edited, a <strong>commit</strong> records <strong>changes</strong> to one or more files in your branch. Git assigns each <strong>commit</strong> a unique ID, called a SHA or hash, that identifies: The specific <strong>changes</strong>. When the <strong>changes</strong> were made.</p><h3 id="push-function push() { [native code] }1">Push</h3><p>Say I‚Äôve created an index.html file in my text editor and I want to share it on the <strong><strong>MyProject</strong></strong> repository, so that all my coworkers can see how awesome I am at coding in HTML.</p><p>Using the command line, the <strong><strong>git status</strong></strong> command will notify you of any changes your <strong>GitHub </strong>repository recognizes in your local folder, that do not yet exist online. Typing <strong><strong>git status</strong></strong> will display your <strong><strong>index.html</strong></strong> in red, indicating it has not yet been <strong><strong>pushed </strong></strong>to your <strong>GitHub </strong>repository.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">git add index.html
git commit -m "added index.html file"
git push</code></pre><p>Pushing is a three step process. First, <strong><strong>git add index.html</strong></strong> to signify that you‚Äôd like to add your index.html file to your <strong>GitHub </strong>repository. Second, <strong><strong>git commit -m ‚Äúmessage‚Äù</strong></strong>, replacing the placeholder message with the <em><em>meaning</em></em> of your adding this file. It is best to keep commit messages specific, so that when you share your code, coworkers (&amp; your followers) can understand your code creating process exactly. Lastly, <strong><strong>git push</strong></strong> to send your added files &amp; commit message off to your GitHub repository.</p><p>If you need to commit all you changes, then you can use the following commands.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">git add -A
git commit -am "added new changes"
git push</code></pre><h3 id="pull">Pull</h3><p>As mentioned, your project code is simultaneously existing both locally and virtually. What if a colleague updates a file &amp; pushes it to the <strong><strong>MyProject</strong></strong> repository ‚Äî how do you ensure you can access this file &amp; work on it, when it does not exist on your local computer?</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">git pull</code></pre><p>The answer is simple: <strong><strong>git pull</strong></strong>. Pulling from your GitHub repository and into your local computer makes sure that your local folder contains the most recent versions of the files in your repository. If you <strong><strong>pull</strong></strong> prior to editing any code, you‚Äôll ensure that you‚Äôre not making any updates which already exist in your repository.</p><p>I will add more updates to this article as I improve it.

I gave it a try by making it on <a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress </a>once, but it didn't feel personal enough. I realized that I didn't just want to have my own blog, I wanted to create it myself personally, like I engineered it with a bit of my lazy computer programming skills. So until then, I collected all the documents and images of my projects and endeavors and waited for the opportunity to do this.</p><p>I was able to get the exact opportunity to re-attempt this in 2020 when I saw the <a href="https://blog.ramith.fyi/static/">blog</a> of a young undergraduate from the 17 batch; Ramith Hettiarachchi, who also happens to be from the SEF ScholarX Class of 2019. </p><p>Ramith had a very attractive blog, which looked very personal and well developed. I would like to extend my personal thanks to Ramith for his advice and support (and especially on how he got me out of the Netlify trouble which could have ended up in this particular article being entirely different to what it is now), in helping me write about my experience on "HOW I MADE MY ¬†SELF-HOSTED PERSONAL BLOG USING GHOST AND GITHUB PAGES".</p><blockquote>PLEASE NOTE: I did everything on my Laptop which was running Windows 10. I didn't dual boot my laptop to get Linux thanks to the amazing work they have done with Windows Subsystem for Linux ¬†(WSL). Also, I did everything for FREE, which is how I like to work on projects. &gt;Great results for Low Budget! üòâ </blockquote><h2 id="what-i-wanted-to-build">What I wanted to build?</h2><p>I was very excited about the year 2020, even though (so far) it was one of the most terrible years in Human History. This was solely due to the fact that 2020 opened up new avenues for me (and Netflix said a Narnia remake is coming soon üòç), in various fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Blogging and Product Development Research to name a few. I wanted to pick up some new skills I could use in my future career as well.</p><p>Ramith had used this API called <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, which was a powerful and unique system for publication content creation and management. Together with Gatsby, it was the entire FRONT-END FRAMEWORK I needed to make my custom personal blog.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/11-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Building my personal blog ‚úçÔ∏è"><figcaption>How Ghost integrates with Gatsby.</figcaption></figure><p>The entire blog had to be hosted on GitHub, and then I could build and deploy my new project with Netlify, and it will be hosted on the internet like any other Blog.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/05/12-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Building my personal blog ‚úçÔ∏è"><figcaption>How Ghost+Gatsby can be used to host on Netlify for the End User</figcaption></figure><blockquote>NOTE: This was how I envisioned everything to be developed at first.

I believe that they are doing a really wonderful endeavor by helping the local students in our country get connected with internationally acclaimed industrial and academic personnel. There efforts are truly helping to convert the long existing Brain Drain of Sri Lanka into a Brain Gain, of which I am very supportive to be a part of and will continue to help towards this endeavor.</p><p>To begin the first chapter of my ScholarX journey, I contacted my mentor Ruwandi Kariyawasam, Ph.D. Candidate at University of Toronto for the first time on April 27<sup>th</sup>. Before sending her my first email, I went on the internet to search about her research profile like a responsible freshly selected mentee.</p><p>These were the main articles I found and referred about my mentor, who was a researcher in the field of tropical infectious diseases with a background in evolutionary genetics.</p><ul><li><a href="https://ims.utoronto.ca/ruwandi-kariyawasam/">https://ims.utoronto.ca/ruwandi-kariyawasam/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruwandikariyawasam/?originalSubdomain=ca">https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruwandikariyawasam/?originalSubdomain=ca</a></li><li><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ruwandi_Kariyawasam">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ruwandi_Kariyawasam</a></li></ul><p>I found this to be really fascinating and given that the world was also facing the Covid-19 pandemic during this period. This was an opportunity for me to tell about my interest in artificial intelligence and share this article I recently read <a href="https://diginomica.com/how-canadian-ai-start-bluedot-spotted-coronavirus-anyone-else-had-clue">https://diginomica.com/how-canadian-ai-start-bluedot-spotted-coronavirus-anyone-else-had-clue</a> about how AI is being used together with infectious diseases.</p><p>We had our first google meets meeting for Scholar X Class of 2020 on May 1<sup>st</sup> , where we got to meet and get advice from Akshika, Saumiyaa and Minuri, the main organizers behind the ScholarX 2020 program. Minuri gave us this <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html">neat tool</a>, to schedule our meetings with our mentors affectively, regardless of the time zone differences. </p><p>So I reached out to Ruwandi by email by introducing myself and a bit about my background from the last 4 years. After we exchanged introductions and the mandatory ScholarX 2020 guidelines via email, I was wondering if I should send her my CV. Since at our first ScholarX meeting, Saumiyaa had mentioned that our mentors were not provided with our CVs, ¬†I thought it would be good to send her my CV. In reply to the email I sent with my CV, Ruwandi replied with a suggestion to arrange our first meeting on the 14<sup>th</sup> of May. I was at home during the Lockdown, and I was very enthusiastic to meet her, and agreed for the meeting. She suggested that we meet around 8.30 am in SL time, and I thought I would go ahead and use that tool Minuri gave us. This is what the meeting looked like. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/06/31-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="My First Chapter of ScholarX '20"><figcaption>It was 11.00 pm for Ruwandi in Toronto!</figcaption></figure><p>So, I prepared my questions and waited till the date of our first meeting. Even though I was not used to waking up very early the past few weeks, I made sure to wake up at 7.45 am on Thursday, 14<sup>th</sup> of May. I got up and freshened up and logged on to Skype and tried to find her Skype ID. It was around 8.30 am now, and I found her on skype and sent her message saying that I was online. However, she did not respond for a while, and I received a message from another person saying ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm sorry late for being late‚Äù and it happened to be Ruwandi on a different account. From the first moment we got to know each other, she was really nice and helpful in person as she was on email. I felt like I was very happy to have chosen her as my mentor and mostly to have a mentor who was a Canadian.</p><p>Our meeting went on for around 45 minutes meeting, which was around 11.45 pm from her time. I was very grateful that she would set aside so much time for me, that late at night. She was also kind enough to send me some really useful links for the things we discussed during the meeting as well. Some of the things we discussed during that meeting are listed below.</p><ul><li>How is Canada a potential higher studies venue for me and details about Graduate Studies in Canada - <a href="https://www.educanada.ca/programs-programmes/graduate-studies-etudes-superieures.aspx?lang=eng">https://www.educanada.ca/programs-programmes/graduate-studies-etudes-superieures.aspx?lang=eng</a></li><li>How to go through the research funding and awards opportunities for doing higher studies in Canada - <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/science/researchfunding.html">https://www.canada.ca/en/services/science/researchfunding.html</a></li><li>Also discussed about researching the start-ups in Toronto related to Biomedical Sector - MaRS Discovery District (BlueDot is actually located here): <a href="https://www.marsdd.com/">https://www.marsdd.com/</a></li><li>Go through opportunities in UBC Toronto McMasters for Engineering PhDs <a href="https://www.bme.ubc.ca/">https://www.bme.ubc.ca/</a>													<a href="https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/">https://ibbme.utoronto.ca/</a></li><li>About writing my first blog post about the ScholarX program and what we learned and shared, as well as making my website.</li></ul><p>She mentioned that my CV was really good, and that I would have a good chance of getting into a nice program and mentioned some things I could improve on. I noted down her suggestions for everything and also decided that I would convert my CV into an academic CV for future use as well.</p><p>We decided to have another meeting on May 28<sup>th</sup>, after I researched all of the information I found on the above matters. However, she had informed me later that week that we will have to reschedule our next meeting, since she will be defending her Ph.D. thesis in the middle of June. I wished her all the very best with her defense and told her that I will be well prepared for the next meeting with her, once her thesis defense was concluded. So, I have been spending my time doing some research on these topics that past few weeks and well as going to be spending the upcoming weeks on this matter as well.</p><p>I found some articles informative articles and content which I used for this, which I have listed below</p><ul><li>How Uthmani Ambawattage, a Graduate in Statistics got selected to a Canadian University - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-got-selected-graduate-school-ranked-8th-canada-ambawattage/">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-i-got-selected-graduate-school-ranked-8th-canada-ambawattage/</a></li><li>AcadeMix project by SEF - <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XhIM3iQTuHkHp7htM2dZlUCY_3yg-ulFy6bd6ZluR4g/edit#gid=795641311">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XhIM3iQTuHkHp7htM2dZlUCY_3yg-ulFy6bd6ZluR4g/edit#gid=795641311</a></li></ul><p>I also decided to get some advice from Eran Withana from his Webinar - The Journey After the College Degree: Getting into Grad School and Beyond - <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sustainableeducationfoundation/videos/598750607475382/"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sustainableeducationfoundation/videos/613380142679095/">https://www.facebook.com/sustainableeducationfoundation/videos/598750607475382/</a></a>.

We thought of sharing a small idea about this amazing and hot topic.</p><h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2><p>Why is AI (Artificial Intelligence) a hot topic?</p><p>As you may have guessed, it is because of it being so modern. Many researchers and top minds in the world work in this field. Companies invest a lot of money in this field. Everyone wants a part in this huge surge.</p><p>Before we begin, to give an idea as to why this topic is important; I guess the best statement we can provide for that is</p><ul><li>Experience with Artificial Intelligence is the top skill employers look for in people applying for jobs in the technical industry ‚Äì regardless of you being a programmer or not.

For anyone in any field (okay‚Ä¶ almost any field), this will be a really valuable tool. And for everyone, having a rough idea on Deep Learning will be definitely useful.</p><p>An icon in this field, Andrew Ng says the following. Electricity changed the entire world about a century back. The way everything worked changed. Deep Learning is the new electricity. It‚Äôs already begun to revolutionize the world! You need to embrace it.</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>Where did this all start?</p><p>When researchers started to investigate on ways to simulate or model biological structures to create computer or engineering systems, they noticed that the structure of the biological NERVOUS SYSTEM was a very interesting and motivating phenomenon.</p><p>Even though we do not fully understand it, the modelling of biological nervous systems, (or biological neural networks) led to something referred to as artificial neural networks (ANN‚Äôs) ‚Äì a term used today to coin computer generated neural network modelling.</p><p>So how do these biological NN‚Äôs and ANN‚Äôs relate? The structure of the Neuron plays an important role in this connection as well. This is a part of biology.</p><p>Try this video crash course!

The inputs bring in the information, then they are weighted and summed up, and finally if the result is above the threshold, then the output/activation is given out.

And created a huge (or in this case DEEP) neural network. Like this (think of each circle as a neuron);</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/06/image-24.png" class="kg-image" alt="DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS:
A LAYMAN‚ÄôS INTRODUCTION"><figcaption>Two different types of Neural Networks</figcaption></figure><p>If you have some experience with programming, you‚Äôll know that a task like looking at a picture and telling whether it‚Äôs a hotdog or not is extremely difficult for a computer (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACmydtFDTGs">this</a> is funny). Learning representations in data is hard. Neural networks do something called representational learning: identifying patterns and representing that data internally in its own way. So a neural network trained on hotdog images would internally represent those images in some way.</p><p>More depth (in DNNs) simply means ability to learn more complex representations. A deeper neural network can identify more complex patterns in the data input to it. These DNNs are only revolutionizing the world today: every sector is feeling its effects quite strong. They‚Äôre taking over vision and robotics, sound analysis, automation, financial analysis, decision making, and so many other tasks previously deemed impossible for computers.</p><p>Quite soon, Deep Learning will be a skill everyone requires, just like being familiar with how to use the internet is essential for everyone. The reason is the large number of deep learning APIs and platforms present today: there are systems as user friendly as MS Word that allow you to train massive DNNs on massive datasets with close to no knowledge. Even better, there are tool that allow you to use already trained DNNs specialized for all sorts of tasks: these actually require no DNNs knowledge at all.</p><h2 id="don-t-believe-us">Don‚Äôt believe us?</h2><p>So any Neural Network (including all DNNs) have two significant stages associated to them. First is the manufacturing stage, termed as training, where we use all sorts of algorithms to internally construct the representations of data we want it to store. This can be likened to a human brain storing what is a hotdog and what isn‚Äôt after someone shows you lots of pictures of hotdogs. Or when you meet Barney, you remember who is Barney (from his face) and who isn‚Äôt Barney (everyone who‚Äôs face doesn‚Äôt look like that). We used a fancy term: ‚Äúpretrained DNNs‚Äù. These are DNNs that were already taught something. If you‚Äôre going to use one of these (this is a good starting point for a beginner, as well as anyone who doesn‚Äôt look to go to research but just build stuff using these), you don‚Äôt need any knowledge at all about ¬†DNNs. All you need is to get familiar with the available platforms and tools. Tensorflow has some great pre-trained models you can use for certain work. Amazon and IBM have some even more user-friendly APIs you can use for image-processing and natural language processing. Google has a fair share of their APIs too. These are great for integrating into work. Some are just as simple as sending a request with a picture and receiving response with details of what‚Äôs in the picture, and also all the objects in it completely segmented and classified by their name.</p><p>So once you have your hands on a trained DNN, all you do is ‚Äúinference‚Äù. Just like you‚Äôd use what‚Äôs in your head to look at a picture of me and realize I‚Äôm not Barney, the inference stage is about taking new inputs and using our internal representations (within the DNN) of hotdogs to see if the new pictures are hotdogs or not. So someone working with applications of DNNs, this is all you would need to work with.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2020/06/image-23.png" class="kg-image" alt="DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS:

Python is a popular language used in the Deep Learning community so I would suggest starting off with it.</p><p>If you‚Äôre using windows, installing all the libraries may be time consuming; we would strongly suggest using an environment and package manager like <strong>Ananconda</strong>. Even for Linux uses, this just makes life a lot easier.</p><p>Start this off today itself! Do not take my word for it. After doing this you‚Äôll realize you need no DNNs knowledge to get a DNN running. Though you‚Äôll need a bit of programming knowledge to setup the stuff. If all this looks Greek to you and still want to try out something, don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôll realize DNNs have be made accessible to an unbelievable extent.</p><h2 id="total-beginner">Total Beginner?</h2><p>Google and Microsoft have some cool APIs you should check out.</p><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/">https://cloud.google.com/vision/</a></p><p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/</a></p><p>Also here‚Äôs some interesting work which had a graduate from our university involved as well.</p><p><a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~szheng/crfasrnndemo">http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~szheng/crfasrnndemo</a></p><p>For many people from web developers to embedded device people, these kind of APIs are going to be extremely useful. Also, most pretrained DNNs can be run (the inference part) completely on your front-end (in JS) and even on an embedded device (in C).
